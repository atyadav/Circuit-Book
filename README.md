# Circuit-Book Overview
This compilation features my endeavors concerning the Circuit Book Product, encompassing 10 distinct cards/designs.

The primary aim of the Circuit Book is to educate young learners about the fundamentals of electronics through the creation of functional circuits on paper, thereby facilitating simultaneous theoretical learning and practical application.

It consists of a series of Paper Circuit cards, with each card representing a basic electronic circuit accompanied by a real-world example/application. Through these cards, children can not only grasp theoretical concepts but also engage in hands-on experimentation, fostering an enjoyable learning experience. To assemble the circuits, one requires a battery, copper or nylon conductive tape, readily available electronic components, and the circuit cards themselves.

For guidance on utilizing the cards, refer to the following YouTube video: [YouTube Link](https://youtu.be/Ev0PvsdgItg?si=kxI9LXUboW1CIjqt)

The primary objective of making these cards accessible to the public is to encourage community involvement in refining existing designs, introducing new electronic cards, and facilitating sharing within the community for widespread utilization.
