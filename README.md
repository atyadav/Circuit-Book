# Circuit-Book
This contains my work on Circuit Book Product. Contains 10 cards / designs.

Objective of the Circuit Book is too teach young students about basics of electronics by creating working circuits on Paper.

It is a collection of Paper Circuit cards, each card denoting a basic electronic circuit along with a real-life example/application of the same. Kids can basically learn about the stuff as well as do it in person and derive the fun.  TO build the circuits you shall need a battery, copper / nylon conductive tape, off the shelf electronics components along with the circuit cards itself. 

Check this you tube videos to check how to make use of the cards -

Objective of making these cards public is to get community involved in imporving existing designs, adding new electronic cards and share with community to use.
